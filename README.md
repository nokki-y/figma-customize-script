## Important Notes
- The script will deactivate once the Figma file is closed. Therefore, it needs to be re-executed every time you open a file.
  - The Developer Tools console keeps a history of executed scripts, allowing you to rerun the script from the history in subsequent uses (press `â†‘` in the console to see the last executed command).
